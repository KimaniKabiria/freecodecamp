      <h3 id="assignment">Assignment</h3>
<p>Complete the <code>Category</code> class in <code>budget.py</code>. It should be able to instantiate
objects based on different budget categories like <em>food</em>, <em>clothing</em>, and
<em>entertainment</em>. When objects are created, they are passed in the name of the
category. The class should have an instance variable called <code>ledger</code> that is a
list. The class should also contain the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>deposit</code> method that accepts an amount and description. If no description
 is given, it should default to an empty string. The method should append an
 object to the ledger list in the form of
 <code>{&quot;amount&quot;: amount, &quot;description&quot;: description}</code>.</li>
<li>A <code>withdraw</code> method that is similar to the <code>deposit</code> method, but the amount
 passed in should be stored in the ledger as a negative number. If there are
 not enough funds, nothing should be added to the ledger. This method should
 return <code>True</code> if the withdrawal took place, and <code>False</code> otherwise.</li>
<li>A <code>get_balance</code> method that returns the current balance of the budget
 category based on the deposits and withdrawals that have occurred.</li>
<li>A <code>transfer</code> method that accepts an amount and another budget category as
 arguments. The method should add a withdrawal with the amount and the
 description &quot;Transfer to [Destination Budget Category]&quot;. The method should
 then add a deposit to the other budget category with the amount and the
 description &quot;Transfer from [Source Budget Category]&quot;. If there are not enough
 funds, nothing should be added to either ledgers. This method should return
 <code>True</code> if the transfer took place, and <code>False</code> otherwise.</li>
<li>A <code>check_funds</code> method that accepts an amount as an argument. It returns
 <code>False</code> if the amount is greater than the balance of the budget category and
 returns <code>True</code> otherwise. This method should be used by both the <code>withdraw</code>
 method and <code>transfer</code> method.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the budget object is printed it should display:</p>
<ul>
<li>A title line of 30 characters where the name of the category is centered in a
 line of <code>*</code> characters.</li>
<li>A list of the items in the ledger. Each line should show the description and
 amount. The first 23 characters of the description should be displayed, then
 the amount. The amount should be right aligned, contain two decimal places,
 and display a maximum of 7 characters.</li>
<li> A line displaying the category total.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of the output:</p>
<pre><code>*************Food*************
initial deposit        1000.00
groceries               -10.15
restaurant and more foo -15.89
Transfer to Clothing    -50.00
Total: 923.96
</code></pre>
<p>Besides the <code>Category</code> class, create a function (outside of the class) called
<code>create_spend_chart</code> that takes a list of categories as an argument. It should
return a string that is a bar chart.</p>
<p>The chart should show the percentage spent in each category passed in to the
function. The percentage spent should be calculated only with withdrawals and
not with deposits. Down the left side of the chart should be labels 0 - 100. The
&quot;bars&quot; in the bar chart should be made out of the &quot;o&quot; character. The height of
each bar should be rounded down to the nearest 10. The horizontal line below the
bars should go two spaces past the final bar. Each category name should be
written vertically below the bar. There should be a title at the top that says
&quot;Percentage spent by category&quot;.</p>
<p>This function will be tested with up to four categories.</p>
<p>Look at the example output below very closely and make sure the spacing of the
output matches the example exactly.</p>
<pre><code>Percentage spent by category

<p>The unit tests for this project are in <code>test_module.py</code>.</p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>Write your code in <code>budget.py</code>. For development, you can use <code>main.py</code> to test
your <code>Category</code> class. Click the &quot;run&quot; button and <code>main.py</code> will run.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>We imported the tests from <code>test_module.py</code> to <code>main.py</code> for your convenience.
The tests will run automatically whenever you hit the &quot;run&quot; button.</p>
