        <h1>Hi, my name is Tai</h1>

        <p>Who am I? Well, I'm all of these:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A curious learner who can't stop his mind thinking about how stuff
            works, what makes them possible and to what limit could we push
            them.
          </li>
          <li>
            A perfectionism who care even the tiny details that others usually
            ignore.
          </li>
          <li>A man who keep his words.</li>
          <li>
            A Software Engineer with an entrepreneurial mindset and poetry's
            heart.
          </li>
          <li>A teacher, a chef, a gamer, a gambler, ...</li>
          <li>Finally, a husband and a father.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          As of 2021, I know a bit of Frontend development and read some books
          on UI/UX, but most of my work is Backend, so I decided to learn FE
          again on freeCodeCamp. This site is one of the results.

            My other works are mostly backend related, so can't share here.
