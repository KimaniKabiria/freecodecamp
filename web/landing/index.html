            As you use it you begin to think in it. Vim is set up to function
            like a language, complete with nouns, verbs, and adverbs. Once you
            learn the language, you will see there's no better way to edit text.

          The author of this site loves Vim. Thank to Vim, he considers
          softwares that don't have a good key-binding, force us to use the
          mouse and low-effort documentations is bad. He learned the habit of
          RTFM to deeply understand whatever he use and use them efficiently.
          The way he manipulates his terminal tools, IDE is insane. If you're
          interesting, see his
