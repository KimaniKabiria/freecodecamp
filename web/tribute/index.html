        <p>
          <strong>Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie</strong>
          (<time datetim="1941-09-09">September 9, 1941</time> â€“
          <time datetime="2011-10-12">October 12, 2011</time>) was an American
          computer scientist.
        </p>

        <p>
          He created the <em>C programming language</em> and, with long-time
          colleague Ken Thompson, the
          <em>Unix operating system and B programming language </em>. Ritchie
          and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the
          Hamming Medal from the
          <abbr title="Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers">
            IEEE
          </abbr>

          in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill
          Clinton in 1999. Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System
          Software Research Department when he retired in 2007.

              Ritchie started working at Bell Labs in 1967. Here is where he
              worked on Multics operating system.

              Ritchie earned his bachelor's degree in Physics in 1963, and
              completed his Doctorate degree in Mathematics in 1968 from Harvard
              University.

              Bell Labs dropped the Multics operating systems project in 1969.
              This prompted Ritchie to develop C programming language and, with
              Thompson, create the UNIX operating system.

              Unix was released on November 3rd, 1971, opening a operating
              system to work on a variety of platforms with highly adapted
              quality.

              Ritchie and Thompson's operating system was not functioning on the
              more advanced PDP-11 mini computer in 1971. This prompted Ritchie
              to create C programming lanuage. C programming lanuage is very
              popular and important to the development of software including
              programs such as C++ and Java.

              Ritchie and Thompson wrote UNIX using C programming language. This
              allowed for UNIX to work a wide variety of computers in a range of
              large and minicomputers and advanced to simple computers.

              Cowinner (with Ken Thompson) of the A.M. Turing Award. It is a
              prestigious award and the top achievement in Computer Science.
              They recieved this award for, "their development of generic
              operating systems theory and specifically for the implementation
              of the UNIX operating system" (Hosch).

              In 1995 Ritchie (and his team) released Plan 9 operating system.
              Plan 9 attempted to integrate graphics and networking into a Unix
              platform. "They kept the Unix choice to mediate access to as many
              system services as possible through a single big file-hierarchy
              name space" (Plan 9).

              Ritchie (with team members) released the inferno Operating System
              in April 1996. Inferno is a operating system for building
              distributed and networked systems on a large range of platforms
              and systems. "You can fectch it now as Free Software, on similar
              terms to Linux orxBSD" (Inferno).
