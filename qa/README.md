# Quality Assurance with Chaii

This contains my modified code to pass the challenge.

Skimming through the course, this is not a challenging one for me. The problem
is they expect a public site with a working [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
server to handle API call. So I need to setup a Heroku box. This in tern
requires to setup a secret key to deploy from Github to Heroku via Actions.
